# Color Notes

- `./swatches` provides a set of colors to be used cross themes.

## Interactions
- Primary actions should be obvious. Solid, high contrast background
colors work great here.
- Secondary actions should be clear but not prominent. Outline styles or
lower contrast background colors are great options.
- Tertiary actions should be discoverable but unobtrusive. Styling these
actions like links is usually the best approach.

> Ex: Button: Filled (Primary) > Outline (Secondary) > Ghost (Tertiary)

or teal to highlight a new feature:
- You might also need colors to emphasize different semantic states, like red
for confirming a destructive action:

## How to use the colors?
Next, pick your darkest shade and your lightest shade. There’s no real
science to this either, but it helps to think about where they will be used and
choose them using that context.

The darkest shade of a color is usually reserved for text, while the lightest
shade might be used to tint the background of an element.

A simple alert component is a good example that combines both of these
use cases, so it can be a great place to pick these colors.
